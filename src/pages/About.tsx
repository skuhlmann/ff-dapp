              designer based in Bristol, UK. After spending a decade designing
              wayfinding systems for cities all over the world, in 2021 he made

              collections, editions, 1/1s and his innovative narrative-focussed
              project Prometheus Lab, as well as collaborating with some of the
              biggest names in the scene.

              inspiration from struggles with mental health, sci-fi and horror,
              punk, hardcore and related genres of music, as well as tattoo
              culture.
